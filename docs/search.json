The Board is worried about the relatively high turnover, and your team must look into ways to reduce the number of employees leaving the company. The team needs to understand better the situation, which employees are more likely to leave, and why. Once it is clear what variables impact employee churn, you can present your findings along with your ideas on how to attack the problem.\n\n\nCreate a report that covers the following:\n\nWhich department has the highest employee turnover? Which one has the lowest?\nInvestigate which variables seem to be better predictors of employee departure.\nWhat recommendations would you make regarding ways to reduce employee turnover?"

a measure of employee satisfaction from surveys.\n“bonus” - 1 if the employee received a bonus in the previous 24 months, 0 otherwise.\n“avg_hrs_month” - the average hours the employee worked in a

Firstly, a trade off exists between performance review and satisfaction ratings. That is, as performance scores increases across employees, they also tend to have lower satisfaction ratings. This feature is even more pronounced for employees who have left. Suggesting that, as they work harder to attain higher performance review, they’re putting themselves at a higher risk of burnout and leaving. This relationship is also salient across departments.\n\n\nShow the code\nplot_rev_sat_left<- empl_turnover %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=review,y= satisfaction, color=left)) +\n  geom_point(alpha=0.16) + \n  geom_smooth(method=lm,se=FALSE)+\n  facet_wrap(~department, ncol=4)+\n   ggpubr::theme_pubclean()+\n   labs (x = \"Review\", \n         y = \"Satisfaction Level\",\n         title= \"\") +\n  theme(\n          strip.background= element_rect(fill= \"white\", linetype = \"blank\"),\n          strip.text = element_text(color= \"black\", face= \"bold\"),\n          strip.text.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size= 10),\n          \n          plot.title = element_text(size =9, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.55),\n          plot.title.position = \"plot\")+\n          scale_color_manual(values=c(\"gray\", \"#2166AC\"))\n\n\n\nplot_rev_sat_left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation"
